        "\n",
        "To verify that we gave them the best outcomes from our exploratory data analysis  we concentrated more on the problem descriptions and data cleaning in the initial phase. Data cleaning was the biggest hurdle for us. Duplicate entries and Null values must both be removed in order to ensure that the data is of high quality. We discovered that 13.60% of the reviews had NaN values during the Data Cleaning process, and even after combining the two data frames, we were unable to make many deductions to fill them. We had to drop down them as a result.\n",

        "There were only 816 distinct apps in the combined data frame from the play store and user evaluations. This is only 10% of the cleaned data; had at least 70% to 80% of the data been available in the merged data frames, we might have provided a more insightful analysis. \n",

        "\n",
        "I came to the conclusion that users choose free apps more. Since most of the apps in the Google Play Store are roughly the same size, size is irrelevant. The goal of the entire project was to evaluate the data and identify the key factors that influence users' decisions to download applications.\n",

These values could have been used to understand the sentiments of each category, which would have helped us fill the Reviews column's 13.60% NaN values.\n",
        "     \n",
        " We have observed that 92.6% of the apps in the Google Play store are free, while 7.4% are paid.   it means that on playstore the certain app categories have more free apps available for download than others\n",
        "\n",
        "It was discovered that the majority of apps on the Google Play market have ratings between 4 and 5. Additionally, it was noted that the dataset's majority of applications are of a tiny size.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to determine whether the app is performing better or worse than other apps on the Play Store, it is possible to use the \"Ratings\" feature of the app to check whether the actual ratings of the app match the anticipated rating.\n",
        "\n",
        "we discovered the relationship between size and rating, can be seen between them. We discover that the bulk of highly rated apps (rated over 4) fall between 2 MB to 40 MB in size.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our analysis of the sentiment distribution, we discovered that the (Health and Fitness) category performs the best, with more than 85% positive ratings, as shown by our visualization of the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral reviews for each category. Although there are more positive and bad reviews in the (game) category.\n",
        "\n",
        "We discovered that positive reviews outnumber the negative and neutral ones, with 64% of reviews being positive.\n",
        "\n",
